		<p>Stereotype threat &#8220;refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&#8217;s group&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. While I am familiar with some of the research on stereotype threat, I had not previously seen any of Steele&#8217;s talks. Notably, even more than any article I have read on the topic, his presentations made me realize how prevalent the issue is&#8211;how it is not limited to a specific community or space (academic, personal, work, etc.).</p>




<p>An individual may have numerous social identities, including but not limited to age, sex, religious affiliation, race, occupation, etc; Steele argued that it is possible that no two people have the same set of social identities<sup>2</sup>. The social identities that one &#8220;can&#8217;t put down&#8221; are called identity contingencies. If the social identity requires one to deal with something in a particular situation as a result of the identity, then it is likely that social identity will become more important to that person&#8211;this is an identity contingency.</p>




<p>As an example, Steele describes when he first realized he was black. Similarly, while I recall identifying as Muslim early in life, I more clearly saw myself as different from many of my peers around Christmas each year. I attended an elementary school with mostly white students in a suburb in California; I did not find it notable that I did not celebrate Christmas until I was not able to relate with my peers, serving only as a starting point for numerous other moments where I felt like an outsider. Interestingly, I related with Muslim peers outside of school with ease, a discernible contrast from the othering I felt at school.</p>




<p>While my example does not explicitly speak to stereotype threat, I feel it is necessary to begin a conversation on the issue with an understanding of social identities and identity contingencies, as both are relevant to the source of and perhaps the response to stereotype threat. Steele argues that the most psychologically impactful identity contingencies are those that in some way threaten the individual&#8211;stereotype threat is a subtle identity contingency. He cites Amin Maalouf from <u>In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong</u>: &#8220;People often see themselves in terms of whichever one of their allegiances (identities) is under attack&#8230;whether he accepts or conceals it, proclaims it discretely or flaunts it, it is with that allegiance that the person concerned identifies&#8221;<sup>3</sup>.</p>




<p>With that said, I have felt stereotype threat in numerous situations. For one, while I love traveling, I hate airports and airport security. I identify as South Asian, Muslim, and American (born and raised), and I have been stopped for extensive searches at airports more times than I can count. What&#8217;s more, on all international flights back to the U.S. save for one, I have been subject to numerous &#8220;random&#8221; searches, sometimes at all available checkpoints. Once, while departing for the US from a country in South America, I was stopped 7 times; at some point, it stopped feeling random.</p>




<p>In this particular instance, I could not help but get angry; at the last of the 7 searches, I lectured the safety agent (sidebar: it worked &#8211; they did not search me as thoroughly as they did the person before me). Unfortunately, I also could not help but feel incredible guilt after the fact. I did not like that I had possibly validated stereotypes about the Muslim and/or South Asian community; I know had reason to feel aggressive but still could not stop feeling guilty for misrepresenting Muslims or South Asians. I feel this burden every day&#8211;at work, on the street, with friends&#8211;especially in light of NYPD surveillance of the Muslim community and related post-9/11 Islamophobia. It means I have to temper speaking up against injustices with a desire to make sure my actions or words adequately represent the Muslim and/or South Asian community while also not making the situation any worse for them. Lots of pressure, I know.</p>




<p>Beyond the Muslim and South Asian social identities, presently, other significant identity contingencies in which I feel or recently felt stereotype threat include: age at work (I&#8217;m the youngest by 15-20 years and was hired at age 25 in a career, teachers&#8217; union representative, that many do not associate with youth); identification as an activist (this video sums up the stereotype threat I feel in this respect: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKucPh9xHtM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKucPh9xHtM&feature=youtu.be</a>; and occupation while a student at an education graduate school (I had trouble participating in classes for fear the points I would make would be overshadowed by how others perceived teachers&#8217; unions).</p>




<p>To respond to stereotype threat, I think it is important to consider research on stereotype threat. Specifically, Steele speaks of the value of coaching people to make an identity more or less salient. Research &#8220;demonstrates that within a stereotyped group, some members may be more vulnerable to its negative consequences than others; factors such as the strength of one&#8217;s group identification or domain identification have been shown to be related to ones&#8217; subsequent vulnerability to stereotype threat&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. In any particular situation, group, or community&#8211;including a learning community like DBC&#8211;it would be valuable to recognize who is most vulnerable to stereotype threat as well as the cues that cause it. Our cultural blog posts on stereotype threat could be a great resource for this. Acknowledging and understanding that these threats may exist is a first step. Afterward, there should be a collective effort to ensure those who identify with particular contingencies are not feeling threatened due this association. These efforts can begin with language &#8211; as a blatant example, it is misguided to tell a class that the most intelligent will succeed on a particular learning task.</p>




<p>In the same vein, Steele describes the value of engaging leadership and using normative influence. Leaders set norms for how organizations and institutions function; they can make a space more or less identity safe. DBC seems to have a strong culture of feedback; it is not just a practice in which Boots and instructors naturally engage, it is also an organizational policy and expectation. DBC leadership has explicitly set this norm. Within it, there could&#8211;and should&#8211;be explicit attention given to making feedback identity safe. &#8220;Making feedback identity safe&#8221; involves understanding cues and mechanisms behind stereotype threat and considering how one should modify how they provide feedback, what words they specifically use.</p>




<p>To make the environment around me more welcoming, it is important for me to be conscientious and self-reflective. I hope to be (and hope that I have been in the past) purposeful with how I communicate, reflective on how it may come across, and responsive when I find I should correct myself or if I see I am able to help someone.</p>

		<p>This week&rsquo;s technical blog covers blocks, procs, and lambdas. I opted to research blocks, procs, and lambdas because, while I recall using them through Code Academy, I was not able to connect them to what I have learned in the past few weeks without some Googling.i</p>

<p>Blocks, procs, and lambdas are all examples of closures. Closures are functions or references to functions that are bound to the scope in which they were created. Closures meet the following criteria: can be passed around as a value; can be executed on demand by anyone who has that value; and, can refer to variables from the context in which it was created (even if those variables are no longer in scope) (source: <a href="http://www.technicalecstasy.net/closures-in-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">http://www.technicalecstasy.net/closures-in-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/</a>). They are helpful for: refactoring, customization, iterating across collections, managing resources, and enforcing policy <sup>1</sup>.i</p>

<p><b><u>Blocks</u></b> are the most commonly used closure. They are also amongst the few exceptions to the “everything is an object” rule in Ruby. They are considered nameless functions, and they use curly braces
<font face="Times New Roman">{..}</font>or
<font face="Times New Roman">do&hellip;end</font>syntax. They can&rsquo;t be saved to a variable - so they don’t have the powers of a Ruby object.i</p>

<p>Below are examples of blocks.</p>

<p>In Example 1, the block is just a function that takes a single argument x and prints that argument to the screen<sup>2</sup>:i
<u>Example 1</u>
i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In Example 2, the #collect! method is used on an Array with a block of code. Within the method, the block takes each variable in the array and squares it.i
<u>Example 2</u>
i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collect!</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inspect</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Though blocks are useful and syntactically simple, their namelessness presents a problem when one wants to have many different blocks to be used multiple times. To do this, the block would need to be saved as a variable. This is where Procs come in! To save a block to a variable, you have to make it a <b><u>Proc!</u></b>
i</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proc&rdquo; is short for procedure. Basically, procs are saved blocks. Because they are saved, they are objects that can be passed around. Procs can help make code DRYer. And, as previously alluded, they allow one to write a function once and then pass it to lots of different functions. A Proc is made by using Proc.new and passing a block, by Proc.new {|x| x}, or by using the proc keyword, prox {|x| x}<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Below are examples of Procs.i</p>

<p>In Example 3, a Proc is used to save a function in the variable greeting; the function prints “Hello World.”<sup>1</sup>
i</p>

<p><u>Example 3</u>
i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">greeting</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In Example 4, doubler is a variable with a Proc that doubles a n. The function in doubler (available as a Proc) is able to be used multiple times without rewriting for two arrays.i</p>

<p><u>Example 4</u>
i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">doubler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">collect</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">doubler</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; [2,4,6]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">doubler</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; [20,40,60]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notable aspects of procs to remember:i</p>

<ul>
    <li>-A return from inside exits completely out of the method enclosing the Proc.<sup>3</sup>
    </li>
    <li>-A Proc doesn&#8217;t care about the arguments passed. If you define a Proc with two parameters, and you pass only 1, or possibly 3, it keeps on trucking. In the case of 1 argument, the second parameter will have the value nil. If you pass extra arguments, they will be ignored and lost.<sup>3</sup>
    </li>
</ul>


<p><b><u>Lambdas</u></b>, on the other hand, are a more strict form of proc, though they are used almost identically like procs. Specifically, lambdas “check the number of arguments passed to them, whereas procs do not. Lambdas return differently than do procs&#8221;<sup>2</sup>.i
Comparing a lambda to a proc, you can see they are syntactically very similar:i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello DBC! }</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2"># equivalent to</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">Proc.new {puts “Hello DBC!”}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And, here is another example of a lambda:i</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;Farheen&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Faizah&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Farnaz&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">symbolize</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_sym</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">symbols</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">names</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">symbolize</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt; :Farheen, :Farnaz, :Faizah</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s likely even clearer from examples provided that lambdas are very similar to procs. Their main differences include: lambdas check the number of arguments received and return an Argument Error if they do not match; when a proc encounters a return statement in its execution, it halts the method and returns the provided value, and lambda returns the value fo teh method and allows it to continue<sup>4</sup>.</p>

		<p>This post will discuss when and how to use instance variables and class variables with Class in Ruby.
Ruby is an object-oriented language in which everything is an object. A class is the factory that builds an object. To create a class, define the characteristics of the class through methods. Then, make an instance of it; an object can be built by a certain class and is called &lsquo;an instance of that class.&rsquo;
Here is a class definition with one instance method for the class Welcome:</p>

<p>Here is an instance of Welcome:</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/create_instance_example.png" alt="Create instance example" /></p>

<p>Now, we can call the method week_five within class Welcome:</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/call_method_example.png" alt="Call method example" /></p>

<p>Both instance variables and class variables are variables found only in instance and class methods. How are they different? Let’s take a look at a few ways!</p>

<h3>Instance Variable</h3>

<p>An instance variable begins with @. Instance variables can be referenced by any method of a particular class. They are bound to the instance of the particular class. Instance variables are initialized through the instance method initialize.</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/instance_variable_example.png" alt="Instance Variable Example" /></p>

<p>In the example, there are two instances explicated &ndash; see comments. This makes two different objects, because both objects set different values for their instance variables. Remember that how an instance variable is defined is bound to a particular instance of the class.</p>

<h3>Class Variable</h3>

<p>A class variable begins with @@. They are shared across all instances of a class&ndash;they are found in instance methods, class methods, and in the class definition itself, outside of any method. They are initialized in the class definition itself. Class Variable is important to pay attention to when using inheritance with classes.</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/class_variable_example.png" alt="class variable example"></p>

<p>In the example, one class (FamilyWithNewBaby) inherits from another (Family). And, though there are two instances of the class, @@members is able to be changed between them.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this helped you understand instance variables and class variables a bit more. Other resources to explore are listed below. Enjoy!</p>
