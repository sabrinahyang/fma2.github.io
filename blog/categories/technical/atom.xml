    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is &ldquo;a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/Test-driven_development.PNG" alt="TDD Development Cycle">
<small>
    <center>A graphical representation of the development cycle, using a basic flowchart<sup>1</sup>
    </center>
</small></p>

<p>Generally speaking, the cycle includes the following steps:</p>

<p><li>(1) Decide what the code will do</li>
<li>(2) Write a test that will pass when the code runs</li>
<li>(3) Run the test, see it fail</li>
<li>(4) Write the code&ndash;just enough production code to fulfill the written test</li>
<li>(5) Run the test, see it pass</li>
<li>(6) Repeat the above process for every couple of lines of code <sup>2</sup>
</li></p>

<p>Some refer to the steps as RED, GREEN, and REFACTOR.</p>

<blockquote>
<li>1) Understand the requirements of the story, work item, or feature that you are working on.</li>
<li>2)
    <font color="red">Red</font>: Create a test and make it fail&#8211;it is expected for it to fail, as it ensures your code is working.</li>
<li>3)
<font color="green">Green</font>: Make the test pass by any means necessary. Write the production code to make the test pass. Keep it simple.</li>
<li>4)<font color="purple">Refactor</font>: Change the code to remove duplication in your project and to improve the design while ensuring that all tests still pass. Repeat the cycle. Each cycle should be very short, and a typical hour should contain many Red/Green/Refactor cycles<sup>3</sup>.</li>
</blockquote>


<p>Check out this video for more on this process:</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HhwElTL-mdI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>As the video describes, TDD encourages design of testable code, which means better planning leading to better results. Amongst many uses, writing testable code through TDD forces the developer to break things down (i.e. code is modular), ensures code is not too tightly woven (referred to as decoupled design), and includes methods with limited scope.</p>

<h3>Benefits of TDD</h3>


<p><li>TDD enables the developer to take small steps when writing software. Many find this practice to be more productive than attempting to code in large steps. Further, it is easier to find and fix defects in code<sup>4</sup>.
</li>
<li>Each test provides feedback to the developer that each component is working.</li>
<li>The tests also provide documentation to the developer</li>
<li>After the test passes and the code is refactored, &ldquo;it is clear that the code is finished, and the developer can move on to a new test&rdquo; <sup>3</sup>
</li>
<li>Test-driven development forces critical analysis and design because the developer cannot create the production code without truly understanding what the desired result should be and how to test it <sup>3</sup>.
</li>
<li>Reduces debugging time.</li>
<li>Overall, advocates of TDD feel <u>it leads to better design in less time</u>.</li></p>

<h3>Objections to TDD</h3>


<p><li>To be able to write better code in less time, one needs to get used to TDD before he/she gets faster.</li>
<br>
<li>The basic steps are easy to learn but the mindset takes a while to sink in. And, before it sinks in, &ldquo;TDD will likely seem clumsy, slow, and awkward&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>. It may take 2 to 3 months of full-time TDD use to adapt.</li>
<br>
<li>It promotes microdesign over macrodesign and can be hard to apply in practice<sup>6</sup>. <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/2014/05/11/the-pitfalls-of-test-driven-development/" alt="Pitfalls of Test Driven Development" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting blog post on these points.</li></p>

    <link href="http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/06/07/wk-7-technical-optimizing-sql-queries/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-07T17:56:13-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/06/07/wk-7-technical-optimizing-sql-queries</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will discuss ways to optimize SQL queries. I will limit it to SQL query optimization options within my current scope of understanding of SQL syntax in an effort to apply the tips as soon as possible. However, I should note that, when researching the topic, I found various other SQL query optimization suggestions.</p>


<p>SQL query optimization is important for better performance. A query is a request for information from a database. Database structures are complex, so it is not surprising that &#8220;the needed data for a query can be collected from a database by accessing it in different ways, through different data-structures, and in different orders&#8221;<sup>1</sup>&#8211;this is performed through SQL statements. What can change with different SQL statements is processing time. Query optimization is meant to &#8220;find the way to process a given query in minimum time&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. Why optimize SQL queries? ServerWatch argues, &#8220;Time is money and people don&#8217;t like to wait so programs are expected to be fast&#8221;<sup>2</sup>.</p>


<p>Here are two approaches to optimize your SQL queries with a few examples of each in practice&#8211;</p>




<h2>APPROACH #1: ONLY QUERY WHAT YOU REALLY NEED</h2>




<p><u><font face="roboto slab" color="#666666">Use the actual column names in SELECT statements instead of &#8216;*&#8217;</font></u>. &#8220;This is, hands-down, the biggest, baddest SQL optimization violation out there. If you considered &#8220;SELECT *&#8221; to be off limits in your applications, I bet that would clear up a sizable chunk of the SQL problems that applications have&#8221;<sup>3</sup>
</p>




<h3>
    <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666" size="3">BAD</font>
</h3>


<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT *
    <br>FROM users;
</p>


<h3>
    <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666" size="3">GOOD</font>
</h3>


<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT id, first_name, last_name, age
    <br>FROM users;
</p>




<p><u><font face="roboto slab" color="#666666">Be careful with conditions in the WHERE clause</font></u>. Write it according to what you need/what you want.
</p>




<h3>
    <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666" size="3">BAD</font>
</h3>


<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT id, first name, last_name, age
    <br>FROM users
    <br>WHERE age != 10;
</p>


<h3>
    <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666" size="3">GOOD</font>
</h3>


<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT id, first name, last_name, age
    <br>FROM users
    <br>WHERE age > 10;
</p>

</h3>


<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT id, first_name, age
    <br>FROM student_details
    <br>WHERE SUBSTR(first_name,1,3) = &#8216;Cha&#8217;;

    <br>FROM users
    <br>WHERE first_name LIKE &#8216;Chan%&#8217;;
</p>




<p><u><font face="roboto slab" color="#666666">Use the HAVING clause appropriately</font></u>. It is used to filter the rows after allthe rows are selected; if you do not need to do this, then you do not need a HAVING clause <sup>4</sup>
</p>




<h3>
    <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666" size="3">BAD</font>

<p style="padding: 10px;background-color: #E0E0E0 ; font-family:Courier; border: black 0.5px solid">SELECT subject, count(subject)

    <br>WHERE subject != &#8216;Science&#8217;
    <br>AND subject != &#8216;Maths&#8217;
    <br>GROUP BY subject;
</p>




<h2>APPROACH #2: CONSIDER HOW DIFFERENT OPERATORS WORK/WHAT OPERATORS ARE APPROPRIATE</h2>




<p><u><font face="roboto slab" color="#666666">Use operator EXISTS, IN,and table joins appropriately in your query</font></u>. &#8220;Usually, IN has the slowest performance. IN is efficient when most of the filter criteria is in the sub-query. EXISTS is efficient when most of the filter criteria is in the main query.&#8221;<sup>4</sup>
</p>

    <br>FROM product p
    <br>WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * from order_items o
    <br>WHERE o.product_id = p.product_id)
</p>




<p><u> <font face="roboto slab" color="#666666">Try not to use the NOT operator.</font></u> It is much faster to search for an exact match using the LIKE, IN, EXIST or = symbol operator (positive operators) instead of NOT LIKE, NOT IN, NOT EXIST or != symbol (negative operators). A negative operator will &#8220;cause the search to find every single row&#8221; whereas the positive operator stops as soon as the result is found.</p>

    <link href="http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/wk-6-technical-blocs-procs-lambdas/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-31T17:55:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/wk-6-technical-blocs-procs-lambdas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week&rsquo;s technical blog covers blocks, procs, and lambdas. I opted to research blocks, procs, and lambdas because, while I recall using them through Code Academy, I was not able to connect them to what I have learned in the past few weeks without some Googling.i</p>

<p>Blocks, procs, and lambdas are all examples of closures. Closures are functions or references to functions that are bound to the scope in which they were created. Closures meet the following criteria: can be passed around as a value; can be executed on demand by anyone who has that value; and, can refer to variables from the context in which it was created (even if those variables are no longer in scope) (source: <a href="http://www.technicalecstasy.net/closures-in-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">http://www.technicalecstasy.net/closures-in-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/</a>). They are helpful for: refactoring, customization, iterating across collections, managing resources, and enforcing policy <sup>1</sup>.i</p>

<p><b><u>Blocks</u></b> are the most commonly used closure. They are also amongst the few exceptions to the “everything is an object” rule in Ruby. They are considered nameless functions, and they use curly braces
<font face="Times New Roman">{..}</font>or
<font face="Times New Roman">do&hellip;end</font>syntax. They can&rsquo;t be saved to a variable - so they don’t have the powers of a Ruby object.i</p>

<p>Below are examples of blocks.</p>

<p>In Example 1, the block is just a function that takes a single argument x and prints that argument to the screen<sup>2</sup>:i
<u>Example 1</u>
i</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">(1..10).each do |x|
puts x
end
</code></pre>

<p>In Example 2, the #collect! method is used on an Array with a block of code. Within the method, the block takes each variable in the array and squares it.i
<u>Example 2</u>
i</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array.collect! do |n|
n ** 2
end
puts array.inspect
</code></pre>

<p>Though blocks are useful and syntactically simple, their namelessness presents a problem when one wants to have many different blocks to be used multiple times. To do this, the block would need to be saved as a variable. This is where Procs come in! To save a block to a variable, you have to make it a <b><u>Proc!</u></b>
i</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proc&rdquo; is short for procedure. Basically, procs are saved blocks. Because they are saved, they are objects that can be passed around. Procs can help make code DRYer. And, as previously alluded, they allow one to write a function once and then pass it to lots of different functions. A Proc is made by using Proc.new and passing a block, by Proc.new {|x| x}, or by using the proc keyword, prox {|x| x}<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Below are examples of Procs.i</p>

<p>In Example 3, a Proc is used to save a function in the variable greeting; the function prints “Hello World.”<sup>1</sup>
i</p>

<p><u>Example 3</u>
i</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">greeting = Proc.new { puts "Hello World!" }
greeting.call
</code></pre>

<p>In Example 4, doubler is a variable with a Proc that doubles a n. The function in doubler (available as a Proc) is able to be used multiple times without rewriting for two arrays.i</p>

<p><u>Example 4</u>
i</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">doubler = Proc.new { |n| n * 2}
[1,2,3].collect (&amp;doubler)
# =&gt; [2,4,6]
[10,20,30].map (&amp;doubler)
# =&gt; [20,40,60]
</code></pre>

<p>Notable aspects of procs to remember:i</p>

<ul>
    <li>A return from inside exits completely out of the method enclosing the Proc.<sup>3</sup>
    </li>
    <li>A Proc doesn&#8217;t care about the arguments passed. If you define a Proc with two parameters, and you pass only 1, or possibly 3, it keeps on trucking. In the case of 1 argument, the second parameter will have the value nil. If you pass extra arguments, they will be ignored and lost.<sup>3</sup>
    </li>
</ul>


<p><b><u>Lambdas</u></b>, on the other hand, are a more strict form of proc, though they are used almost identically like procs. Specifically, lambdas “check the number of arguments passed to them, whereas procs do not. Lambdas return differently than do procs&#8221;<sup>2</sup>.
Comparing a lambda to a proc, you can see they are syntactically very similar:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">lambda { puts "Hello DBC! }
# equivalent to

Proc.new {puts “Hello DBC!”}
</code></pre>

<p>And, here is another example of a lambda:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">names = ["Farheen", "Faizah", "Farnaz"]
symbolize = lambda { |e| e.to_sym}
symbols = names.collect{&amp;symbolize}
#=&gt; :Farheen, :Farnaz, :Faizah
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely even clearer from examples provided that lambdas are very similar to procs. Their main differences include: lambdas check the number of arguments received and return an Argument Error if they do not match; when a proc encounters a return statement in its execution, it halts the method and returns the provided value, and lambda returns the value fo teh method and allows it to continue<sup>4</sup>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will discuss when and how to use instance variables and class variables with Class in Ruby.
Ruby is an object-oriented language in which everything is an object. A class is the factory that builds an object. To create a class, define the characteristics of the class through methods. Then, make an instance of it; an object can be built by a certain class and is called &lsquo;an instance of that class.&rsquo;
Here is a class definition with one instance method for the class Welcome:</p>

<p>Here is an instance of Welcome:</p>

<p>Now, we can call the method week_five within class Welcome:</p>

<p>Both instance variables and class variables are variables found only in instance and class methods. How are they different? Let’s take a look at a few ways!</p>

<h3>Instance Variable</h3>

<p>An instance variable begins with @. Instance variables can be referenced by any method of a particular class. They are bound to the instance of the particular class. Instance variables are initialized through the instance method initialize.</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/instance_variable_example.png" alt="Instance Variable Example" /></p>

<p>In the example, there are two instances explicated &ndash; see comments. This makes two different objects, because both objects set different values for their instance variables. Remember that how an instance variable is defined is bound to a particular instance of the class.</p>

<h3>Class Variable</h3>

<p>A class variable begins with @@. They are shared across all instances of a class&ndash;they are found in instance methods, class methods, and in the class definition itself, outside of any method. They are initialized in the class definition itself. Class Variable is important to pay attention to when using inheritance with classes.</p>

<p><img src="https://fma2.github.io/unit1_projects/images/class_variable_example.png" alt="class variable example"></p>

<p>In the example, one class (FamilyWithNewBaby) inherits from another (Family). And, though there are two instances of the class, @@members is able to be changed between them.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this helped you understand instance variables and class variables a bit more. Other resources to explore are listed below. Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With hopes of better understanding both languages conceptually, I researched Ruby versus Javascript for this weeks&#8217; technical blog. Here are my findings!</p>

<h4>Benefits vs. Drawbacks</h4>

<p>In recent exposure to both languages, I have noticed the following differences:</p>

<h5>How they define functions</h5>

<p>Javascript has two ways of defining functions: function expressions and function declarations.</p>

<p>Ruby has multiple types of functions: blocks, Procs, lambdas. Ruby also has methods and method objects.</p>

<h5>Iterations</h5>

<p>While both languages will have state, condition, and iterator in object iteration there are significant differences.</p>

<p>Javascript only has a few ways to iterate: for loops, array methods.</p>

<p>Ruby has a wealth of methods to use for loops and iterators (while, until, for, #each, #times, upto, downto, each_index). Often, there are abstractions hidden in each of these methods. It is challenging to understand all of these methods as a beginner.</p>

<h5>Attention to syntax</h5>

<p>JavaScript requires much more attention to curly braces, parenthesis, commas, and semicolon. Sometimes problems are caused by simple misplacement of or forgotten punctuation like these rather than larger conceptual problems</p>

<p>Ruby does not demand as much attention to curly braces, parenthesis, etc. It is much more minimalisitic, and it allows one to focus on concepts versus syntax.</p>

<h5>When it is used</h5>

<p>Javascript is more commonly used for front-end,client-side web development</p>

<p>Ruby is used for back-end, server-side web development</p>

<h5>Which one should you pick?</h5>

<p>I think it depends on what you are trying to do, learn, or make. Useful questions to consider at first:</p>

<p>Is it client-side of server-side? Are you a beginner? Would focusing on syntax or concepts be more helpful to you?
Next, check out how both languages rank on Hammer Principle: Programming Languages: JAVASCRIPT VS RUBY! Consider what you&rsquo;re priorities are, check to see if they have been ranked on Hammer Principle, and think about the results. This should get you started on deciding which to pick!</p>

<h5>Check out the code!</h5>
