    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Society demands &ldquo;a higher level and different set of skills than schools were designed to teach&rdquo;(<a href="http://www.leadered">source</a>). Even with the addition of computers in the classroom, teaching and school structures largely remain unchanged. There are many changes that could and should be made. In general, there continue to be ongoing challenges of access, adequacy and equity of technology in schools(<a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/PB19_Technology08.pdf">source</a>). In this post, I want to focus on K-12 computer science education.</p>

<p>In a 2013 report entitled &ldquo;Bugs in the System: Computer Science Teacher Certification in the U.S.&rdquo;, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) describe a disconnect between the number of US jobs in computing and teacher credentialing in K-12 computer science education. They reference the Bureau of Labor and Statistics which found that by 2020 there will be 9.2 million jobs in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) with more than half of these jobs in computing. They claim, &ldquo;The economic well-being of of the United States depends on computing, which in turns depends on a robust computing workforce&rdquo;(<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). In a recent report, a team at the University of Chicago found five major challenges to computer science education: a lack of shared understanding of what computer science is; a need for more comprehensive, quality instructional resources; a lack of prioritization of computer science in schools; a dearth of computer science teachers; and isolation fo computer science teachers (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>).</p>

<p>While efforts could be made to include computer science in required coursework for high school graduation, preparing teachers for these courses deserves attention as well. Computer Science teacher certification/licensure requirements differ state-by-state, with some states lacking any requirements, or even a certification option, at all. Further, the report &ldquo;Bugs in the System&rdquo; calls it a â€œdeeply flawed systemâ€ with several problematic symptoms: confusion about Computer Science as a discipline, a dearth of clear and relevant certification/licensure requirements, and a lack of agreement about what teachers should know and understanding in order to be exemplary teachers (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we convince K-12 school systems to require computer science coursework, based on present and future job demands, at least. How can we ensure there are well-prepared teachers for these courses? It would be a monumental task to try to change credentialing/licensure requirements nationwide, but it should likely begin sooner rather than later. We could also begin to consider the following to at least begin to counter the multitude of challenges with K-12 computer science education:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess K-12 curricula to find opportunities to include CS principles and/or specific lessons.</li>
<li>Modify K-12 curricula to include critical thinking exercises and project-based learning opportunities.</li>
<li>Work with localities and districts to reconfigure the work day to include consistent, effective professional development for teachers on technology.</li>
<li>Partner teachers and school districts with tech companies.</li>
<li>For the short term, the team at University of Chicago recommends there be strategies to help existing teachers become excellent CS teachers. Existing teachers could include teachers already teaching computer science or even those teaching related subject areas (math, science, etc.). Strategies could include consistent professional development or training opportunities (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>.</li>
</ul>
