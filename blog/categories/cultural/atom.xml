    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Gregorc, Ph. D., a phenomenological researcher, lecturer, consultant, author and President of Gregorc Associates <sup>1</sup>, organized a model describing different learning styles<sup>2</sup>. Referred to as the Gregorc Mind Styles model, it is theory that &#8220;provides an organized way to consider how the mind works&#8221; <sup>1</sup>. The model is based on &#8220;the existence of perceptions&#8211;our evaluation of the world by means of an approach that makes sense to us&#8221;<sup>2</sup>. Perceptions impact our specific learning strengths.</p>




<p>The model considers: two perceptual qualities, concrete and abstract; and two ordering abilities, sequential and random. In regards to perceptual qualities, concrete quality &#8220;enables you to register information directly through your five senses&#8221;, while abstract quality &#8220;allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, and to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. For ordering abilities, sequential ability &#8220;allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner,&#8221; and random ability &#8220;lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order&#8221; <sup>1</sup>. These components pair into four combinations:</p>




<ol>
    <li><u>Concrete Sequential (CS)</u>: These Thinkers &#8220;tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way&#8221;.</li>
    <li><u>Abstract Random (AR)</u>: These Thinkers &#8220;organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.</li>
    <li><u>Abstract Sequential (AS)</u>: These Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.</li>
    <li><u>Concrete Random (CR)</u>: These Thinkers are experimenters <sup>3</sup>.</li>
</ol>




<p>It&#8217;s important to note that &#8220;no one is a &#8216;pure&#8217; style. Each of us have a unique combination of natural strengths and abilities&#8221;<sup>1</sup>.</p>




<p>I completed the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Thinking Style quiz</a> with the following results, Abstract Sequential scoring highest:</p>




<p>I ___ x 4 = 36 Concrete Sequential (CS)
<br>II ___ x 4 = 44 Abstract Sequential (AS)
<br>III ___ x 4 = 20 Abstract Random (AR)
<br>IV ___ x 4 = 20 Concrete Random (CR)
<br>(insert image)</p>




<p>With only 10% of the general population in this category, characteristics of <a href="http://www.cgribben.com/psych/as.html"> Abstract Sequential Thinkers </a> include<sup>1</sup>:</p>


<p>This learner likes:
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;his/her point to be heard</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li></p>

<p>They learn best when:
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;they have access to experts or references</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;placed in stimulating environments</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;able to work alone</li></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s hard for them?
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; thinking</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing their emotions</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not monopolizing a conversation</li></p>

<p>As an Abstract Sequential (AS) Thinker, I anticipate that, once given a project or assignment at DBC, I will likely spend time preparing and researching before beginning. Equipped with all of the necessary information, I will be able to execute the assignment without too much pain, consistently referring to the tools and resources I have collected through the comprehensive prep work. Notably, this process that I, as an Abstract Sequantial Thinker, feel the need to go through is both an advantage and a disadvantage</p>

<p>Specifically, in Phase 0, I found I did not trust my first instincts to my own detriment. This occurred when a challenge covering material that I did know was presented in a way with which I was not as familiar&#8211;either in explicated examples or in the directions or in the use of language or vocabulary terms. Instead of attempting the challenge, I needed to stop and research. Sometimes I was concerned that, if I just began to try different steps, I would waste too much time &#8211;and time was limited due to full-time work obligations. Unfortunately, I could have learned more practical applications through trial-and-error&#8211;instead, I would research theory and online resources.</p>




<p>To allow for this practical learning during Phase 1 and beyond, I anticipate it will help to have more dedicated time to DBC&#8211;this is a plan of action that is luckily already in place (with Phase 1 starting tomorrow). I believe I should also expand my use of the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>. Previously, I used the technique to time myself on a whole challenge; I can easily begin to use it to time myself on parts of the challenge, including the early steps of understanding the problem and trying to immediately apply what I know.</p>




<p>To further improve the ways I learn and think in an effort to be more well-rounded, it is important to consider what AS thinkers find difficult. For one, AS thinkers need time to deal with a subject thoroughly. To grow, especially knowing there will likely not always be enough time, I should make myself available for assignments and challenges that limit time but are within my scope of knowledge. This will hopefully provide me with opportunities to feel successful and allow me to understand that not every subject needs to be dealt with thoroughly to be done right.</p>




<p>Further, AS thinkers struggle with being forced to work with those of differing views and being diplomatic when convincing others. To improve my collaboration abilities, I should begin by listening and observing peers, those with differing views or those I want to convince. From listening and observing, I will likely gain insights and understandings about those with differing views that I could not gain otherwise. Further, I can use those insights in questions and any other points I need to make to be heard when it is my turn to speak.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-15T18:56:27-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/06/15/wk-8-cultural-pairing-and-giving-feedback</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Truth be told, pairing initially felt awkward. It meant I had to meet with a stranger via video chat and accomplish a task&#8211;which required abilities that I was initially not completely confident I had&#8211;in a short period of time. To add to the awkwardness, I was nervous I would not meet the expectations set in <a href="http://vimeo.com/76662569">Pairing is Caring</a>. Notably, I did feel like I understood the purpose and benefits of pairing in theory.</p>




<p>During the second guided pairing session, it finally clicked&#8211;I found I was finally as comfortable with pair programming in practice as I was positive about it in theory. In retrospect, I realize I had not been confident in my technical abilities and was nervous I would be more burdensome than useful. For the second GPS, a guide served as my pair, and he used simple questions when I was stuck to help me me move forward. The questions did not hand me any answers; rather, they made me think about the problem differently, which led me to quickly solve it. Perhaps it was his experience with pairing that made him such a successful guide; either way, it allowed me to experience the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/17/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial/">power of pairing</a>.</p>




<p>Eventually, I grew to greatly appreciate pairing, even with the occasional awkwardness of having to use video chat instead of the ideal of meeting in person. I try to avoid using cliches (sometimes because I don’t understand them as an English Language learner!), but pairing definitely showed that “two heads are better than one.” It was rewarding in so many ways, including the chance to talk out code and find I was on the same page as my pair and then eventually to solve the problem in less time than it would have taken me on my own. I was only occasionally frustrated with myself. When I saw that I was not on the same page as my pair, I felt I needed to communicate more clearly and sometimes was not as comfortable with relevant vocabulary to do so.</p>




<p>For my current full-time job, there are few formal (or informal) protocols in place for feedback. I wish there were more systems, so I unsurprisingly was thrilled to see that not only was feedback expected at DBC but there were also specific guidelines that included a rubric that asked for feedback that was specific, actionable, and kind; timelines to follow; and a check for good feedback through metafeedback.</p>




<p>It was helpful to read feedback; it often confirmed what I thought I needed to improve but also provided other ways to grow I had not considered. Occasionally, the feedback rehashed the success of the pairing session, so it was fun to relive it through written word. Further, it served to keep me accountable&#8211;I knew from the beginning that I would l likely need to spend extra time on technical aspects (as a complete newbie to web development), so, in preparation for pairing sessions, I would do this extra work to ensure there was equity of effort during the session. As a result of feedback, I also reflected on my communication style/s and considered what to remember to do or say during a pairing session.</p>




<p>I actually found writing feedback to be the most difficult part of the process. Notably, I think it is because, while I realize feedback is innately subjective, I felt this need to make it as objective as possible, especially considering the guidelines and expectation to make it specific, actionable, and kind. With that in mind, reviewing others feedback provided valuable examples of how to write good (and occasionally not so good) feedback.</p>




<p>Conclusively, while pairing via Google Hangouts is fine and receiving feedback on these sessions is great, I am mainly looking forward to being able to engage in this productive process in person when Phase 1 begins!</p>

    <link href="http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/06/01/wk-6-cultural-stereotype-threat/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-01T18:55:01-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/06/01/wk-6-cultural-stereotype-threat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stereotype threat &#8220;refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&#8217;s group&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. While I am familiar with some of the research on stereotype threat, I had not previously seen any of Steele&#8217;s talks. Notably, even more than any article I have read on the topic, his presentations made me realize how prevalent the issue is&#8211;how it is not limited to a specific community or space (academic, personal, work, etc.).</p>




<p>An individual may have numerous social identities, including but not limited to age, sex, religious affiliation, race, occupation, etc; Steele argued that it is possible that no two people have the same set of social identities<sup>2</sup>. The social identities that one &#8220;can&#8217;t put down&#8221; are called identity contingencies. If the social identity requires one to deal with something in a particular situation as a result of the identity, then it is likely that social identity will become more important to that person&#8211;this is an identity contingency.</p>




<p>As an example, Steele describes when he first realized he was black. Similarly, while I recall identifying as Muslim early in life, I more clearly saw myself as different from many of my peers around Christmas each year. I attended an elementary school with mostly white students in a suburb in California; I did not find it notable that I did not celebrate Christmas until I was not able to relate with my peers, serving only as a starting point for numerous other moments where I felt like an outsider. Interestingly, I related with Muslim peers outside of school with ease, a discernible contrast from the othering I felt at school.</p>




<p>While my example does not explicitly speak to stereotype threat, I feel it is necessary to begin a conversation on the issue with an understanding of social identities and identity contingencies, as both are relevant to the source of and perhaps the response to stereotype threat. Steele argues that the most psychologically impactful identity contingencies are those that in some way threaten the individual&#8211;stereotype threat is a subtle identity contingency. He cites Amin Maalouf from <u>In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong</u>: &#8220;People often see themselves in terms of whichever one of their allegiances (identities) is under attack&#8230;whether he accepts or conceals it, proclaims it discretely or flaunts it, it is with that allegiance that the person concerned identifies&#8221;<sup>3</sup>.</p>




<p>With that said, I have felt stereotype threat in numerous situations. For one, while I love traveling, I hate airports and airport security. I identify as South Asian, Muslim, and American (born and raised), and I have been stopped for extensive searches at airports more times than I can count. What&#8217;s more, on all international flights back to the U.S. save for one, I have been subject to numerous &#8220;random&#8221; searches, sometimes at all available checkpoints. Once, while departing for the US from a country in South America, I was stopped 7 times; at some point, it stopped feeling random.</p>




<p>In this particular instance, I could not help but get angry; at the last of the 7 searches, I lectured the safety agent (sidebar: it worked &#8211; they did not search me as thoroughly as they did the person before me). Unfortunately, I also could not help but feel incredible guilt after the fact. I did not like that I had possibly validated stereotypes about the Muslim and/or South Asian community; I know had reason to feel aggressive but still could not stop feeling guilty for misrepresenting Muslims or South Asians. I feel this burden every day&#8211;at work, on the street, with friends&#8211;especially in light of NYPD surveillance of the Muslim community and related post-9/11 Islamophobia. It means I have to temper speaking up against injustices with a desire to make sure my actions or words adequately represent the Muslim and/or South Asian community while also not making the situation any worse for them. Lots of pressure, I know.</p>




<p>Beyond the Muslim and South Asian social identities, presently, other significant identity contingencies in which I feel or recently felt stereotype threat include: age at work (I&#8217;m the youngest by 15-20 years and was hired at age 25 in a career, teachers&#8217; union representative, that many do not associate with youth); identification as an activist (this video sums up the stereotype threat I feel in this respect: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKucPh9xHtM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKucPh9xHtM&feature=youtu.be</a>; and occupation while a student at an education graduate school (I had trouble participating in classes for fear the points I would make would be overshadowed by how others perceived teachers&#8217; unions).</p>




<p>To respond to stereotype threat, I think it is important to consider research on stereotype threat. Specifically, Steele speaks of the value of coaching people to make an identity more or less salient. Research &#8220;demonstrates that within a stereotyped group, some members may be more vulnerable to its negative consequences than others; factors such as the strength of one&#8217;s group identification or domain identification have been shown to be related to ones&#8217; subsequent vulnerability to stereotype threat&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. In any particular situation, group, or community&#8211;including a learning community like DBC&#8211;it would be valuable to recognize who is most vulnerable to stereotype threat as well as the cues that cause it. Our cultural blog posts on stereotype threat could be a great resource for this. Acknowledging and understanding that these threats may exist is a first step. Afterward, there should be a collective effort to ensure those who identify with particular contingencies are not feeling threatened due this association. These efforts can begin with language &#8211; as a blatant example, it is misguided to tell a class that the most intelligent will succeed on a particular learning task.</p>




<p>In the same vein, Steele describes the value of engaging leadership and using normative influence. Leaders set norms for how organizations and institutions function; they can make a space more or less identity safe. DBC seems to have a strong culture of feedback; it is not just a practice in which Boots and instructors naturally engage, it is also an organizational policy and expectation. DBC leadership has explicitly set this norm. Within it, there could&#8211;and should&#8211;be explicit attention given to making feedback identity safe. &#8220;Making feedback identity safe&#8221; involves understanding cues and mechanisms behind stereotype threat and considering how one should modify how they provide feedback, what words they specifically use.</p>




<p>To make the environment around me more welcoming, it is important for me to be conscientious and self-reflective. I hope to be (and hope that I have been in the past) purposeful with how I communicate, reflective on how it may come across, and responsive when I find I should correct myself or if I see I am able to help someone.</p>

    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/05/24/wk-5-cultural-challenges-with-computer-science-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Society demands &ldquo;a higher level and different set of skills than schools were designed to teach&rdquo;(<a href="http://www.leadered">source</a>). Even with the addition of computers in the classroom, teaching and school structures largely remain unchanged. There are many changes that could and should be made. In general, there continue to be ongoing challenges of access, adequacy and equity of technology in schools(<a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/PB19_Technology08.pdf">source</a>). In this post, I want to focus on K-12 computer science education.</p>

<p>In a 2013 report entitled &ldquo;Bugs in the System: Computer Science Teacher Certification in the U.S.&rdquo;, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) describe a disconnect between the number of US jobs in computing and teacher credentialing in K-12 computer science education. They reference the Bureau of Labor and Statistics which found that by 2020 there will be 9.2 million jobs in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) with more than half of these jobs in computing. They claim, &ldquo;The economic well-being of of the United States depends on computing, which in turns depends on a robust computing workforce&rdquo;(<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). In a recent report, a team at the University of Chicago found five major challenges to computer science education: a lack of shared understanding of what computer science is; a need for more comprehensive, quality instructional resources; a lack of prioritization of computer science in schools; a dearth of computer science teachers; and isolation fo computer science teachers (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>).</p>

<p>While efforts could be made to include computer science in required coursework for high school graduation, preparing teachers for these courses deserves attention as well. Computer Science teacher certification/licensure requirements differ state-by-state, with some states lacking any requirements, or even a certification option, at all. Further, the report &ldquo;Bugs in the System&rdquo; calls it a â€œdeeply flawed systemâ€ with several problematic symptoms: confusion about Computer Science as a discipline, a dearth of clear and relevant certification/licensure requirements, and a lack of agreement about what teachers should know and understanding in order to be exemplary teachers (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we convince K-12 school systems to require computer science coursework, based on present and future job demands, at least. How can we ensure there are well-prepared teachers for these courses? It would be a monumental task to try to change credentialing/licensure requirements nationwide, but it should likely begin sooner rather than later. We could also begin to consider the following to at least begin to counter the multitude of challenges with K-12 computer science education:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess K-12 curricula to find opportunities to include CS principles and/or specific lessons.</li>
<li>Modify K-12 curricula to include critical thinking exercises and project-based learning opportunities.</li>
<li>Work with localities and districts to reconfigure the work day to include consistent, effective professional development for teachers on technology.</li>
<li>Partner teachers and school districts with tech companies.</li>
<li>For the short term, the team at University of Chicago recommends there be strategies to help existing teachers become excellent CS teachers. Existing teachers could include teachers already teaching computer science or even those teaching related subject areas (math, science, etc.). Strategies could include consistent professional development or training opportunities (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>.</li>

    <updated>2014-05-17T18:53:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/05/17/wk-4-cultural-dealing-with-conflict</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I began teaching several years ago, I was twenty-one years old. It was my first full-time job, and, unsurprisingly, I had trouble communicating with my supervisors Specifically, I found I was able to approach them to discuss students but drew back when I needed to discuss a personal issue.</p>

<p>This led to an emotional conflict regarding personal days. I needed a personal day for travel to a family event. In completing paperwork for the personal day, I did not provide details on the family event. Further, my supervisor preferred that her staff speak to her about personal days before submitting the paperwork&ndash;I did not speak to her but only submitted the paperwork. This disappointed my supervisor. When she approached me about this, I became upset; instead of providing her with information on the personal day or on why I did not speak to her in advance, I responded with little information and visible discomfort. She, in turn, decided that I did not need the personal day, blaming me for her decision. Beyond an issue of adequate communication, it was a conflict of styles. Though it was not required by the contract, she wanted face-to-face communication regarding a personal day (and most other personal issues). I, however, was not comfortable with talking openly about personal needs and issues.</p>

<p>I do not think my actions made the conflict better. At the time, I had already identified that I needed to work on communicating with my supervisors about personal issues. Interestingly, in the compass of shame, I self-identify as someone who is likely to &ldquo;attack self&rdquo;. I think this &ldquo;attack self&rdquo; response led me to further retreat during the conflict.</p>

<p>If I could go back in time, I would have been more conscientious about building my communication skills well before the conflict. Hopefully, in that moment, this would have allowed me to explain the need for the personal day as well as the reason I did not speak to her in advance, at the very least. The experience mostly taught me that I had a lot of work to do on myself.</p>
