	<div class="entry-content"><p>Based on the video, it seems the DBC experience will be as I had hoped. As an educator, I can appreciate DBC&rsquo;s educational philosophy of experimentation, attention to growth over achievement, opinions on pair programming, and use of problem- and project-based learning.</p>

<p>Though I am interested in programming languages, I ultimately chose to apply to DBC because of its explicit emphasis on learning how to think and problem-solve. I specifically like that Shereef described DBCâ€™s attention to engineering principles and engineering sense. Further, related to these emphases is the importance of EQ over IQ. Overall, this is a culture in which I want to be&ndash;notably, this is, in part, because it is not as common as it should be, especially in the sphere of public education. It is a culture that I know will challenge me in a different way than other educational spaces have.</p>

<p>I am excited to participate in the DBC learning environment, but I am also nervous. This is because, as an educator, I understand how impactful it can be, but I am slightly anxious that I will be out of my comfort zone. Reflecting on past educational experiences, there were almost always &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers, which I was expected to find&ndash;this is a task I know I have grown used to. At DBC, I anticipate I will have to let go of this occasional itching desire to find the right solution and appreciate&ndash;through self-reflection, feedback, metafeedback, and any other protocol or DBC or personal system&ndash;the process rather than the product.</p>
