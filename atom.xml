    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h5>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h5>

<p>JavaScript is popular in web development because it is arguably the best language for the web. Here are the top 4 signs it is the best language for the web&ndash;</p>

<h3>1. It is powerful, supporting both client-side and server-side development&ndash;the latter increasingly so.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.nuxeo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/111111_contentgeeks_server_side_600.jpg" alt="Javascript is not this" />
(Javascript != above image)</p>

<p>Though Javascript has been around for a long time, previously, JavaScript was limited to front end development&ndash;web pages, User Interfaces and fetching data, etc. With Node.js and Google&rsquo;s V8 JavaScript Engine, this is quickly changing to more server-side development. Effectively, &ldquo;JavaScript is quickly becoming not just the ideal language for the web, but indeed a big composition of the web itself.&rdquo; It continues to show that is a capable language, especially in &ldquo;ever-growing number of cases where asynchronous communications are necessary.&#8221;1</p>

<h3>2. It has the potential to maximize the user experience.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.luminis.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/UX-Design.png" alt="Heart Website" /></p>

<p>User experience (UX) refers to a person&rsquo;s attitude and behavior towards a product, like a website or application. Apple raised the bar for what is considered acceptable in terms of user experience&ndash;the &ldquo;success and adoption of an app is highly correlated&#8221;2 to this. JavaScript has the potential to deliver the necessary &#8220;rich, dynamic web content&rdquo; 2 that attends to user experience.</p>

<h3>3. It is supported by virtually all browsers and adapts to multiple devices.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/browser-logos-30.jpg" alt="what a mess" /></p>

<p>Effectively, &ldquo;millions of people run browsers that can handle JavaScript&ndash;in some variation or another.&#8221;3 It is standardized across common browsers. Further, most devices&ndash;tablets, e-readers and smart phones&ndash;have javascript language. Javascript is especially useful for devices with Apps.</p>

<h3>4. It is easy to use.</h3>

<p><img src="http://mir.aculo.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doge.jpg" alt="doge loves it too" /></p>

<p>One can add JavaScript to his/her site without &ldquo;having access to a server, compiling programs, or having the browser load a virtual machine.&#8221;3 Running JavaScript is as simple as adding it to a web page and uploading the page. This is significant considering the multitude of user experience features JavaScript can add to a web page. Further, it is easy to pick up because of &#8220;the very flexible nature of the language.&#8221;1</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Based on the video, it seems the DBC experience will be as I had hoped. As an educator, I can appreciate DBC&rsquo;s educational philosophy of experimentation, attention to growth over achievement, opinions on pair programming, and use of problem- and project-based learning.</p>

<p>Though I am interested in programming languages, I ultimately chose to apply to DBC because of its explicit emphasis on learning how to think and problem-solve. I specifically like that Shereef described DBCâ€™s attention to engineering principles and engineering sense. Further, related to these emphases is the importance of EQ over IQ. Overall, this is a culture in which I want to be&ndash;notably, this is, in part, because it is not as common as it should be, especially in the sphere of public education. It is a culture that I know will challenge me in a different way than other educational spaces have.</p>

<p>I am excited to participate in the DBC learning environment, but I am also nervous. This is because, as an educator, I understand how impactful it can be, but I am slightly anxious that I will be out of my comfort zone. Reflecting on past educational experiences, there were almost always &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers, which I was expected to find&ndash;this is a task I know I have grown used to. At DBC, I anticipate I will have to let go of this occasional itching desire to find the right solution and appreciate&ndash;through self-reflection, feedback, metafeedback, and any other protocol or DBC or personal system&ndash;the process rather than the product.</p>

    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/05/03/wk-2-technical-all-about-css-positioning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog post will discuss the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.</p>

<p>The positionproperty is important for making more complex web page layouts. Possible values for this property include:</p>

<ul>
<li>static</li>
<li>relative</li>
<li>absolute</li>
<li>fixed</li>
</ul>


<h4>Static Positioning</h4>

<p>Static positioning is the default position value for any element on a website. Elements with this positioning or no positioning will fall where they are found in the standard flow of a document. These elements scroll normally.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it is written:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">static</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each element in the sample below is in the standard flow of how the HTML was written. The elements either have no positioning or <code>position: static</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/04/27/wk-1-technical-user-experience-and-design-analysis/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-27T13:49:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://fma2.github.io/blog/2014/04/27/wk-1-technical-user-experience-and-design-analysis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Week 1, I selected the following favorite websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Below is analysis of these websites in terms of user experience and design.</p>

<h4>Google Drive</h4>

<p>I visit Google Drive multiple times in a single day to view, edit, and share personal andwork files. I love that I am able to access necessary files from anywhere.</p>

<p>The website has a simple design; it looks similar to a file folder one may find on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Further, files are easily searchable from the search tool. One can search the file name or even text from within a file. A user can also easily organize their files into related folders for easy searching and sharing. For important files, a user can use the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; tool.</p>

<p>Notably, despite this design similarity, there is still a learning curve. First, files do not appear automatically on Google Drive; there are setup and uploading steps. Google Drive also has its own format for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and other types of files. For example, while a user may upload a word processing document created in Microsoft Word, they will not be able to edit it in Google Drive, despite being able to see it. A new user will need to learn these rules to simply view and edit files. An added step for a new user is sharing, which has additional processes that may not be immediately familiar to a new user.</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>I utilize Twitter for quick, recent, and relevant news and information.</p>

<p>The website has user-created content. Users share 140-character text messages called &ldquo;tweets&rdquo; with their followers and on their page, which can be made public or available only to specific users. Users can also view all tweets of followed users on their home page. On this page, tweets appear in order, with the most recent tweet on top; one&rsquo;s home page updates frequently due to constant new tweets from followers. Also, the search tool makes it easy for anyone, whether a registered Twitter user or not, to search users, tweet content, or trending information or hashtags</p>

<p>Twitter can be overstimulating due to the constantly changing tweets feed. In this way, even though the website may only have 5 or so boxes, new tweet after new tweet can make it seem cluttered. The site is used by individuals, companies, and organizations who all may distribute different types of information to followers&ndash;it seems the value of the site can vary depending on this, for both viewers of tweets and tweeters.</p>

<p>I am most excited to use Twitter during specific moments, like the President&rsquo;s State of the Union, elections, awards shows, and important international events (e.g. events in Egypt or Syria). At these moments, Twitter provides minute-by-minute coverage from a seeminly unending supply of sources that is unmatched by any news station.</p>

<h4>Digg Reader</h4>

<p>Digg Reader is another useful site for news and information.</p>

<p>The website aggregates posts from news and related websites; the user subscribes to have these sites appear in his/her Digg Reader. These posts can appear all together under &ldquo;All.&rdquo; Or, the user is able to group these sites into folders for easier reading. Either way, with Digg Reader, the user does not have to visit each of the sites in which they are interested; Digg Reader becomes a one-stop shop for news and information from specific sources.</p>

<p>To browse through content, the user can simply click headlines or they can use keyboard shortcuts. When new content is posted on the websites to which the user is subscribed, &ldquo;__ new items&rdquo; appears in the sidebar. The user can choose to update their feed to include these new items. Unfortunately, there is no visible search option for the user to search their feed for specific articles.</p>

<p>If the user is subscribed to many websites, he/she may never finish reading the content on their Digg Reader. This may make the user feel differently each time he/she uses Digg Reader&ndash;at times, it may feel like he/she wasted a lot of time on information he/she didn&rsquo;t need at that time; other times, he/she may feel they have gained a lot of interesting information after stumbling on several articles from sites they love to follow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I think of times in my life I&rsquo;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, I recall all of the following values:</p>

<p>Activism AdventureAutonomy ChallengeCommunity CompetenceCooperation EfficiencyExcitement FairnessFreedom FriendshipsGrowth Helping other peopleHelping society HonestyIndependence Inner harmonyInsight IntrospectionJustice LeadershipMeaningful work MentorshipPersistance Personal developmentPublic service QualityResponsibility Self-knowledgeSelf-reliance SpiritualityTruth VibrancyWisdom</p>

<p>FAIRNESS</p>

<p>The importance of this value to me stems, in part, from my years as a teacher in the Bronx. All of my students&#8217; families were low-income, most below the poverty line. What motivated me everyday in working with my students was the desire to ensure they had/have access to the same opportunities I, a person who was just lucky to be born into privilege, was afforded growing up &ndash; I seeked fairness.</p>

<p>In general, I try to live up these values: 5</p>

<p>The last topic on which someone asked me advice was career. A friend teaches at a charter school but is interested in other opportunities in education.</p>
