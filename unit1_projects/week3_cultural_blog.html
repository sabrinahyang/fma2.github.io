	<h2>week 3 cultural blog: chefs in the kitchen</h2>
	<p><em>Thursday, May 8, 2014</em></p>
	<p>  
		Based on the video, it seems the DBC experience will be as I had hoped.  As an educator, I can appreciate DBC's educational philosophy of experimentation, attention to growth over achievement, opinions on pair programming, and use of problem- and project-based learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though I am interested in programming languages, I ultimately chose to apply to DBC because of its explicit emphasis on learning how to think and problem-solve.  I specifically like that Shereef described DBCâ€™s attention to engineering principles and engineering sense.  Further, related to these emphases is the importance of EQ over IQ.  Overall, this is a culture in which I want to be--notably, this is, in part, because it is not as common as it should be, especially in the sphere of public education.  It is a culture that I know will challenge me in a different way than other educational spaces have.  
	</p>
	<p> 
		I am excited to participate in the DBC learning environment, but I am also nervous.  This is because, as an educator, I understand how impactful it can be, but I am slightly anxious that I will be out of my comfort zone.  Reflecting on past educational experiences, there were almost always "right" answers, which I was expected to find--this is a task I know I have grown used to.  At DBC, I anticipate I will have to let go of this occasional itching desire to find the right solution and appreciate--through self-reflection, feedback, metafeedback, and any other protocol or DBC or personal system--the process rather than the product.
