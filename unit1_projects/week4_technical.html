	<h2>technical blog: comparing ruby and javascript</h2>
		<p><em>Saturday, May 17, 2014</em></p>
		
		<p>With hopes of better understanding both languages conceptually, I researched Ruby versus Javascript for this weeks' technical blog.  Here are my findings!</p>

<h4>Benefits/Drawbacks</h4>
		
<p> In recent exposure to both languages, I have noticed the following differences:</p>

<p><b>How they define functions</b></p>
	<p>Javascript has two ways of defining functions: function expressions and function declarations.</p>
	<p>Ruby has multiple types of functions: blocks, Procs, lambdas.  Ruby also has methods and method objects.<p>
<p><b>Iterations</b></p>
	<p>While both languages will have state, condition, and iterator in object iteration there are significant differences.</p>
	<p>Javascript only has a few ways to iterate: for loops, array methods.</p>
	<p>Ruby has a wealth of methods to use for loops and iterators (while, until, for, #each, #times, upto, downto, each_index).  Often, there are abstractions hidden in each of these methods.  It is challenging to understand all of these methods as a beginner.</p>
<p><b>Attention to syntax</b></p>
	<p> JavaScript requires much more attention to curly braces, parenthesis, commas, and semicolon.  Sometimes problems are caused by simple misplacement of or forgotten punctuation like these rather than larger conceptual problems</p>
	<p> Ruby does not demand as much attention to curly braces, parenthesis, etc.  It is much more minimalisitic, and it allows one to focus on concepts versus syntax.</p>
<p><b>When it is used</b></p>
	<p>Javascript is more commonly used for front-end,client-side web development</p>
	<p>Ruby is used for back-end, server-side web development</p>
<h4>Which one should you pick?</h4>
<p>
I think it depends on what you are trying to do, learn, or make.  Useful questions to consider at first:
<ul>
	<li>Is it client-side of server-side?</li>
	<li>Are you a beginner?  Would focusing on syntax or concepts be more helpful to you? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Next, check out how both languages rank on Hammer Principle: <a href="http://www.hammerprinciple.com/therighttool/items/javascript/ruby">Programming Languages: JAVASCRIPT VS RUBY</a>! Consider what you're priorities are, check to see if they have been ranked on Hammer Principle, and think about the results.  This should get you started on deciding which to pick!
</p>

<h4>Check out the code!</h4>
	<p>Below are a few examples comparing how to write code for each.</P
