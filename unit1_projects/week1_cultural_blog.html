	<h2>Cultural Blog: Identifying Core Values</h2>
<p> When I think of times in my life I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, I recall all of the following values:</p>
<p>Activism <strong>Adventure</strong> Autonomy<strong> Challenge</strong> Community<strong> Competence</strong> Cooperation<strong> Efficiency</strong> Excitement <strong>Fairness</strong> Freedom <strong>Friendships</strong> Growth <strong>Helping other people</strong> Helping society <strong>Honesty </strong>Independence <strong>Inner harmony</strong> Insight <strong>Introspection</strong> Justice <strong>Leadership</strong> Meaningful work <strong>Mentorship</strong> Persistance <strong>Personal development</strong> Public service <strong>Quality</strong> Responsibility <strong>Self-knowledge </strong>Self-reliance <strong>Spirituality </strong>Truth <strong>Vibrancy</strong> Wisdom</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><font size = "6">FAIRNESS</font></strong></p>
<p>The importance of this value to me stems, in part, from my years as a teacher in the Bronx.  All of my students' families were low-income, most below the poverty line.  What motivated me everyday in working with my students was the desire to ensure they had/have access to the same opportunities I, a person who was just lucky to be born into privilege, was afforded growing up -- I seeked fairness.</p>
<hr>
<p>In general, I try to live up these values: 5</p>
<hr>
<p>The last topic on which someone asked me advice was career.  A friend teaches at a charter school but is interested in other opportunities in education. </p>
