		<p>Society demands &ldquo;a higher level and different set of skills than schools were designed to teach&rdquo;(<a href="http://www.leadered">source</a>). Even with the addition of computers in the classroom, teaching and school structures largely remain unchanged. There are many changes that could and should be made. In general, there continue to be ongoing challenges of access, adequacy and equity of technology in schools(<a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/PB19_Technology08.pdf">source</a>). In this post, I want to focus on K-12 computer science education.</p>

<p>In a 2013 report entitled &ldquo;Bugs in the System: Computer Science Teacher Certification in the U.S.&rdquo;, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) describe a disconnect between the number of US jobs in computing and teacher credentialing in K-12 computer science education. They reference the Bureau of Labor and Statistics which found that by 2020 there will be 9.2 million jobs in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) with more than half of these jobs in computing. They claim, &ldquo;The economic well-being of of the United States depends on computing, which in turns depends on a robust computing workforce&rdquo;(<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). In a recent report, a team at the University of Chicago found five major challenges to computer science education: a lack of shared understanding of what computer science is; a need for more comprehensive, quality instructional resources; a lack of prioritization of computer science in schools; a dearth of computer science teachers; and isolation fo computer science teachers (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>).</p>

<p>While efforts could be made to include computer science in required coursework for high school graduation, preparing teachers for these courses deserves attention as well. Computer Science teacher certification/licensure requirements differ state-by-state, with some states lacking any requirements, or even a certification option, at all. Further, the report &ldquo;Bugs in the System&rdquo; calls it a â€œdeeply flawed systemâ€ with several problematic symptoms: confusion about Computer Science as a discipline, a dearth of clear and relevant certification/licensure requirements, and a lack of agreement about what teachers should know and understanding in order to be exemplary teachers (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>). We need to provide all students with the opportunity to &ldquo;develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of Computer Science as a scientific discipline&rdquo; (<a href="http://csta.acm.org/ComputerScienceTeacherCertification/sub/CSTA_BugsInTheSystem.pdf">source</a>).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we convince K-12 school systems to require computer science coursework, based on present and future job demands, at least. How can we ensure there are well-prepared teachers for these courses? It would be a monumental task to try to change credentialing/licensure requirements nationwide, but it should likely begin sooner rather than later. We could also begin to consider the following to at least begin to counter the multitude of challenges with K-12 computer science education:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess K-12 curricula to find opportunities to include CS principles and/or specific lessons.</li>
<li>Modify K-12 curricula to include critical thinking exercises and project-based learning opportunities.</li>
<li>Work with localities and districts to reconfigure the work day to include consistent, effective professional development for teachers on technology.</li>
<li>Partner teachers and school districts with tech companies.</li>
<li>For the short term, the team at University of Chicago recommends there be strategies to help existing teachers become excellent CS teachers. Existing teachers could include teachers already teaching computer science or even those teaching related subject areas (math, science, etc.). Strategies could include consistent professional development or training opportunities (<a href="http://outlier.uchicago.edu/computerscience/OS4CS/challenges/">source</a>.</li>

		<p>With hopes of better understanding both languages conceptually, I researched Ruby versus Javascript for this weeks&#8217; technical blog. Here are my findings!</p>

<h4>Benefits vs. Drawbacks</h4>

<p>In recent exposure to both languages, I have noticed the following differences:</p>

<h5>How they define functions</h5>

<p>Javascript has two ways of defining functions: function expressions and function declarations.</p>

<p>Ruby has multiple types of functions: blocks, Procs, lambdas. Ruby also has methods and method objects.</p>

<h5>Iterations</h5>

<p>While both languages will have state, condition, and iterator in object iteration there are significant differences.</p>

<p>Javascript only has a few ways to iterate: for loops, array methods.</p>

<p>Ruby has a wealth of methods to use for loops and iterators (while, until, for, #each, #times, upto, downto, each_index). Often, there are abstractions hidden in each of these methods. It is challenging to understand all of these methods as a beginner.</p>

<h5>Attention to syntax</h5>

<p>JavaScript requires much more attention to curly braces, parenthesis, commas, and semicolon. Sometimes problems are caused by simple misplacement of or forgotten punctuation like these rather than larger conceptual problems</p>

<p>Ruby does not demand as much attention to curly braces, parenthesis, etc. It is much more minimalisitic, and it allows one to focus on concepts versus syntax.</p>

<h5>When it is used</h5>

<p>Javascript is more commonly used for front-end,client-side web development</p>

<p>Ruby is used for back-end, server-side web development</p>

<h5>Which one should you pick?</h5>

<p>I think it depends on what you are trying to do, learn, or make. Useful questions to consider at first:</p>

<p>Is it client-side of server-side? Are you a beginner? Would focusing on syntax or concepts be more helpful to you?
Next, check out how both languages rank on Hammer Principle: Programming Languages: JAVASCRIPT VS RUBY! Consider what you&rsquo;re priorities are, check to see if they have been ranked on Hammer Principle, and think about the results. This should get you started on deciding which to pick!</p>

<h5>Check out the code!</h5>

<p>Below are a few examples comparing how to write code for each.<table border="1">

		<p>When I began teaching several years ago, I was twenty-one years old. It was my first full-time job, and, unsurprisingly, I had trouble communicating with my supervisors Specifically, I found I was able to approach them to discuss students but drew back when I needed to discuss a personal issue.</p>

<p>This led to an emotional conflict regarding personal days. I needed a personal day for travel to a family event. In completing paperwork for the personal day, I did not provide details on the family event. Further, my supervisor preferred that her staff speak to her about personal days before submitting the paperwork&ndash;I did not speak to her but only submitted the paperwork. This disappointed my supervisor. When she approached me about this, I became upset; instead of providing her with information on the personal day or on why I did not speak to her in advance, I responded with little information and visible discomfort. She, in turn, decided that I did not need the personal day, blaming me for her decision. Beyond an issue of adequate communication, it was a conflict of styles. Though it was not required by the contract, she wanted face-to-face communication regarding a personal day (and most other personal issues). I, however, was not comfortable with talking openly about personal needs and issues.</p>

<p>I do not think my actions made the conflict better. At the time, I had already identified that I needed to work on communicating with my supervisors about personal issues. Interestingly, in the compass of shame, I self-identify as someone who is likely to &ldquo;attack self&rdquo;. I think this &ldquo;attack self&rdquo; response led me to further retreat during the conflict.</p>

<p>If I could go back in time, I would have been more conscientious about building my communication skills well before the conflict. Hopefully, in that moment, this would have allowed me to explain the need for the personal day as well as the reason I did not speak to her in advance, at the very least. The experience mostly taught me that I had a lot of work to do on myself.</p>

		<h5>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h5>

<p>JavaScript is popular in web development because it is arguably the best language for the web. Here are the top 4 signs it is the best language for the web&ndash;</p>

<h3>1. It is powerful, supporting both client-side and server-side development&ndash;the latter increasingly so.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.nuxeo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/111111_contentgeeks_server_side_600.jpg" alt="Javascript is not this" />
(Javascript != above image)</p>

<p>Though Javascript has been around for a long time, previously, JavaScript was limited to front end development&ndash;web pages, User Interfaces and fetching data, etc. With Node.js and Google&rsquo;s V8 JavaScript Engine, this is quickly changing to more server-side development. Effectively, &ldquo;JavaScript is quickly becoming not just the ideal language for the web, but indeed a big composition of the web itself.&rdquo; It continues to show that is a capable language, especially in &ldquo;ever-growing number of cases where asynchronous communications are necessary.&#8221;1</p>

<h3>2. It has the potential to maximize the user experience.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.luminis.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/UX-Design.png" alt="Heart Website" /></p>

<p>User experience (UX) refers to a person&rsquo;s attitude and behavior towards a product, like a website or application. Apple raised the bar for what is considered acceptable in terms of user experience&ndash;the &ldquo;success and adoption of an app is highly correlated&#8221;2 to this. JavaScript has the potential to deliver the necessary &#8220;rich, dynamic web content&rdquo; 2 that attends to user experience.</p>

<h3>3. It is supported by virtually all browsers and adapts to multiple devices.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/browser-logos-30.jpg" alt="what a mess" /></p>

<p>Effectively, &ldquo;millions of people run browsers that can handle JavaScript&ndash;in some variation or another.&#8221;3 It is standardized across common browsers. Further, most devices&ndash;tablets, e-readers and smart phones&ndash;have javascript language. Javascript is especially useful for devices with Apps.</p>

<h3>4. It is easy to use.</h3>

<p><img src="http://mir.aculo.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doge.jpg" alt="doge loves it too" /></p>

<p>One can add JavaScript to his/her site without &ldquo;having access to a server, compiling programs, or having the browser load a virtual machine.&#8221;3 Running JavaScript is as simple as adding it to a web page and uploading the page. This is significant considering the multitude of user experience features JavaScript can add to a web page. Further, it is easy to pick up because of &#8220;the very flexible nature of the language.&#8221;1</p>

		<p>Based on the video, it seems the DBC experience will be as I had hoped. As an educator, I can appreciate DBC&rsquo;s educational philosophy of experimentation, attention to growth over achievement, opinions on pair programming, and use of problem- and project-based learning.</p>

<p>Though I am interested in programming languages, I ultimately chose to apply to DBC because of its explicit emphasis on learning how to think and problem-solve. I specifically like that Shereef described DBCâ€™s attention to engineering principles and engineering sense. Further, related to these emphases is the importance of EQ over IQ. Overall, this is a culture in which I want to be&ndash;notably, this is, in part, because it is not as common as it should be, especially in the sphere of public education. It is a culture that I know will challenge me in a different way than other educational spaces have.</p>

<p>I am excited to participate in the DBC learning environment, but I am also nervous. This is because, as an educator, I understand how impactful it can be, but I am slightly anxious that I will be out of my comfort zone. Reflecting on past educational experiences, there were almost always &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers, which I was expected to find&ndash;this is a task I know I have grown used to. At DBC, I anticipate I will have to let go of this occasional itching desire to find the right solution and appreciate&ndash;through self-reflection, feedback, metafeedback, and any other protocol or DBC or personal system&ndash;the process rather than the product.</p>

		<p>This blog post will discuss the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.</p>

<p>The positionproperty is important for making more complex web page layouts. Possible values for this property include:</p>

<ul>
<li>static</li>
<li>relative</li>
<li>absolute</li>
<li>fixed</li>
</ul>


<h4>Static Positioning</h4>

<p>Static positioning is the default position value for any element on a website. Elements with this positioning or no positioning will fall where they are found in the standard flow of a document. These elements scroll normally.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it is written:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">static</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each element in the sample below is in the standard flow of how the HTML was written. The elements either have no positioning or <code>position: static</code>.</p>

				Wk 1 Technical: User Experience and Design Analysis</a>

		<p>For Week 1, I selected the following favorite websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Below is analysis of these websites in terms of user experience and design.</p>

<h4>Google Drive</h4>

<p>I visit Google Drive multiple times in a single day to view, edit, and share personal andwork files. I love that I am able to access necessary files from anywhere.</p>

<p>The website has a simple design; it looks similar to a file folder one may find on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Further, files are easily searchable from the search tool. One can search the file name or even text from within a file. A user can also easily organize their files into related folders for easy searching and sharing. For important files, a user can use the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; tool.</p>

<p>Notably, despite this design similarity, there is still a learning curve. First, files do not appear automatically on Google Drive; there are setup and uploading steps. Google Drive also has its own format for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and other types of files. For example, while a user may upload a word processing document created in Microsoft Word, they will not be able to edit it in Google Drive, despite being able to see it. A new user will need to learn these rules to simply view and edit files. An added step for a new user is sharing, which has additional processes that may not be immediately familiar to a new user.</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>I utilize Twitter for quick, recent, and relevant news and information.</p>

<p>The website has user-created content. Users share 140-character text messages called &ldquo;tweets&rdquo; with their followers and on their page, which can be made public or available only to specific users. Users can also view all tweets of followed users on their home page. On this page, tweets appear in order, with the most recent tweet on top; one&rsquo;s home page updates frequently due to constant new tweets from followers. Also, the search tool makes it easy for anyone, whether a registered Twitter user or not, to search users, tweet content, or trending information or hashtags</p>

<p>Twitter can be overstimulating due to the constantly changing tweets feed. In this way, even though the website may only have 5 or so boxes, new tweet after new tweet can make it seem cluttered. The site is used by individuals, companies, and organizations who all may distribute different types of information to followers&ndash;it seems the value of the site can vary depending on this, for both viewers of tweets and tweeters.</p>

<p>I am most excited to use Twitter during specific moments, like the President&rsquo;s State of the Union, elections, awards shows, and important international events (e.g. events in Egypt or Syria). At these moments, Twitter provides minute-by-minute coverage from a seeminly unending supply of sources that is unmatched by any news station.</p>

<h4>Digg Reader</h4>

<p>Digg Reader is another useful site for news and information.</p>

<p>The website aggregates posts from news and related websites; the user subscribes to have these sites appear in his/her Digg Reader. These posts can appear all together under &ldquo;All.&rdquo; Or, the user is able to group these sites into folders for easier reading. Either way, with Digg Reader, the user does not have to visit each of the sites in which they are interested; Digg Reader becomes a one-stop shop for news and information from specific sources.</p>

<p>To browse through content, the user can simply click headlines or they can use keyboard shortcuts. When new content is posted on the websites to which the user is subscribed, &ldquo;__ new items&rdquo; appears in the sidebar. The user can choose to update their feed to include these new items. Unfortunately, there is no visible search option for the user to search their feed for specific articles.</p>

<p>If the user is subscribed to many websites, he/she may never finish reading the content on their Digg Reader. This may make the user feel differently each time he/she uses Digg Reader&ndash;at times, it may feel like he/she wasted a lot of time on information he/she didn&rsquo;t need at that time; other times, he/she may feel they have gained a lot of interesting information after stumbling on several articles from sites they love to follow.</p>

		<p>When I think of times in my life I&rsquo;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, I recall all of the following values:</p>

<p>Activism AdventureAutonomy ChallengeCommunity CompetenceCooperation EfficiencyExcitement FairnessFreedom FriendshipsGrowth Helping other peopleHelping society HonestyIndependence Inner harmonyInsight IntrospectionJustice LeadershipMeaningful work MentorshipPersistance Personal developmentPublic service QualityResponsibility Self-knowledgeSelf-reliance SpiritualityTruth VibrancyWisdom</p>

<p>FAIRNESS</p>

<p>The importance of this value to me stems, in part, from my years as a teacher in the Bronx. All of my students&#8217; families were low-income, most below the poverty line. What motivated me everyday in working with my students was the desire to ensure they had/have access to the same opportunities I, a person who was just lucky to be born into privilege, was afforded growing up &ndash; I seeked fairness.</p>

<p>In general, I try to live up these values: 5</p>

<p>The last topic on which someone asked me advice was career. A friend teaches at a charter school but is interested in other opportunities in education.</p>
