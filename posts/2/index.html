		<p>When I began teaching several years ago, I was twenty-one years old. It was my first full-time job, and, unsurprisingly, I had trouble communicating with my supervisors Specifically, I found I was able to approach them to discuss students but drew back when I needed to discuss a personal issue.</p>

<p>This led to an emotional conflict regarding personal days. I needed a personal day for travel to a family event. In completing paperwork for the personal day, I did not provide details on the family event. Further, my supervisor preferred that her staff speak to her about personal days before submitting the paperwork&ndash;I did not speak to her but only submitted the paperwork. This disappointed my supervisor. When she approached me about this, I became upset; instead of providing her with information on the personal day or on why I did not speak to her in advance, I responded with little information and visible discomfort. She, in turn, decided that I did not need the personal day, blaming me for her decision. Beyond an issue of adequate communication, it was a conflict of styles. Though it was not required by the contract, she wanted face-to-face communication regarding a personal day (and most other personal issues). I, however, was not comfortable with talking openly about personal needs and issues.</p>

<p>I do not think my actions made the conflict better. At the time, I had already identified that I needed to work on communicating with my supervisors about personal issues. Interestingly, in the compass of shame, I self-identify as someone who is likely to &ldquo;attack self&rdquo;. I think this &ldquo;attack self&rdquo; response led me to further retreat during the conflict.</p>

<p>If I could go back in time, I would have been more conscientious about building my communication skills well before the conflict. Hopefully, in that moment, this would have allowed me to explain the need for the personal day as well as the reason I did not speak to her in advance, at the very least. The experience mostly taught me that I had a lot of work to do on myself.</p>

		<h5>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h5>

<p>JavaScript is popular in web development because it is arguably the best language for the web. Here are the top 4 signs it is the best language for the web&ndash;</p>

<h3>1. It is powerful, supporting both client-side and server-side development&ndash;the latter increasingly so.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.nuxeo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/111111_contentgeeks_server_side_600.jpg" alt="Javascript is not this" />
(Javascript != above image)</p>

<p>Though Javascript has been around for a long time, previously, JavaScript was limited to front end development&ndash;web pages, User Interfaces and fetching data, etc. With Node.js and Google&rsquo;s V8 JavaScript Engine, this is quickly changing to more server-side development. Effectively, &ldquo;JavaScript is quickly becoming not just the ideal language for the web, but indeed a big composition of the web itself.&rdquo; It continues to show that is a capable language, especially in &ldquo;ever-growing number of cases where asynchronous communications are necessary.&#8221;1</p>

<h3>2. It has the potential to maximize the user experience.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.luminis.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/UX-Design.png" alt="Heart Website" /></p>

<p>User experience (UX) refers to a person&rsquo;s attitude and behavior towards a product, like a website or application. Apple raised the bar for what is considered acceptable in terms of user experience&ndash;the &ldquo;success and adoption of an app is highly correlated&#8221;2 to this. JavaScript has the potential to deliver the necessary &#8220;rich, dynamic web content&rdquo; 2 that attends to user experience.</p>

<h3>3. It is supported by virtually all browsers and adapts to multiple devices.</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/browser-logos-30.jpg" alt="what a mess" /></p>

<p>Effectively, &ldquo;millions of people run browsers that can handle JavaScript&ndash;in some variation or another.&#8221;3 It is standardized across common browsers. Further, most devices&ndash;tablets, e-readers and smart phones&ndash;have javascript language. Javascript is especially useful for devices with Apps.</p>

<h3>4. It is easy to use.</h3>

<p><img src="http://mir.aculo.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doge.jpg" alt="doge loves it too" /></p>

<p>One can add JavaScript to his/her site without &ldquo;having access to a server, compiling programs, or having the browser load a virtual machine.&#8221;3 Running JavaScript is as simple as adding it to a web page and uploading the page. This is significant considering the multitude of user experience features JavaScript can add to a web page. Further, it is easy to pick up because of &#8220;the very flexible nature of the language.&#8221;1</p>

		<p>Based on the video, it seems the DBC experience will be as I had hoped. As an educator, I can appreciate DBC&rsquo;s educational philosophy of experimentation, attention to growth over achievement, opinions on pair programming, and use of problem- and project-based learning.</p>

<p>Though I am interested in programming languages, I ultimately chose to apply to DBC because of its explicit emphasis on learning how to think and problem-solve. I specifically like that Shereef described DBCâ€™s attention to engineering principles and engineering sense. Further, related to these emphases is the importance of EQ over IQ. Overall, this is a culture in which I want to be&ndash;notably, this is, in part, because it is not as common as it should be, especially in the sphere of public education. It is a culture that I know will challenge me in a different way than other educational spaces have.</p>

<p>I am excited to participate in the DBC learning environment, but I am also nervous. This is because, as an educator, I understand how impactful it can be, but I am slightly anxious that I will be out of my comfort zone. Reflecting on past educational experiences, there were almost always &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers, which I was expected to find&ndash;this is a task I know I have grown used to. At DBC, I anticipate I will have to let go of this occasional itching desire to find the right solution and appreciate&ndash;through self-reflection, feedback, metafeedback, and any other protocol or DBC or personal system&ndash;the process rather than the product.</p>

		<p>This blog post will discuss the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.</p>

<p>The positionproperty is important for making more complex web page layouts. Possible values for this property include:</p>

<ul>
<li>static</li>
<li>relative</li>
<li>absolute</li>
<li>fixed</li>
</ul>


<h4>Static Positioning</h4>

<p>Static positioning is the default position value for any element on a website. Elements with this positioning or no positioning will fall where they are found in the standard flow of a document. These elements scroll normally.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it is written:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">static</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each element in the sample below is in the standard flow of how the HTML was written. The elements either have no positioning or <code>position: static</code>.</p>

		<p><p>Here I consider web pages on the websites Google Drive, Twitter, and Digg Reader. While each website has more than one page, I will look at each site&rsquo;s default page, the page that appears when you go to their basic URL.
<ul>
<li>What problems does each page solve?</li>
<li>What visual challenges are there?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Google Drive</h2>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MQE5h_kZzBc/U11RZNY2WsI/AAAAAAAAT2g/DIrrHrn7PDE/w830-h687-no/Google+Drive+Wireframe+-+New+Page.jpeg" alt="Google Drive Wireframe">
<p>When I go to drive.google.com and log in to my Google account, the page that appears is Google Drive&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>In order to understand the problems this page solves, it&rsquo;s important to first understand the purpose of Google Drive. Google Drive is an application that provides users with online, cloud-based storage space for all files&ndash;these files are accessible from smartphone, tablet, or computer, anywhere the user is. These files can be shared with friends, co-workers, etc., allowing for easy collaboration. Further, files (word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, etc.) can also be created, edited, shared on Google Drive.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;My Drive page lists a user&rsquo;s files or folders; it is the user&rsquo;s home base. From this page, a user can find documents they need to view, edit, and/or collaborate. If the document is not document is not immediately visible on the &#8220;My Drive&rdquo; page, the user can use the search tool at the top of the page to find it easily. The page is simple and looks much like a folder on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive looks with folders and setting options.</p>
<p>Despite its simplicity, there are a few visual challenges. Specifically, there is an expected learning curve for new Google Drive users. In order to understand the many uses of Google Drive, they must first add files to their Drive for any files to actually appear on the &ldquo;My Drive&rdquo; page. Further, the options (My Drive, Shared with Me, Starred) in the sidebar may not be immediately familiar, as they do not easily compare with what folders may look like on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive. In this sense, visually, the page is a challenge for those who do not understand the terms&ndash;though the page is fairly simple in design, the words could be overwhelming without an understanding of their meaning and uses.</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WGdaT7oodYU/U11RZFH85RI/AAAAAAAAT2k/OL4CurZG4pI/w830-h687-no/Twitter+Wireframe+-+New+Page.jpeg" alt="Twitter Wireframe">
<p>When I go to Twitter.com and log in to my Twitter account, the page that appears is my &ldquo;Home&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>Twitter is considered a social networking and micro-blogging website. Users are able to send 140-character messages call &ldquo;tweets&rdquo;. On the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; page, a user is able read the tweets of other users they are following. These can appear on the Home page as they are sent, with the most recent tweet at the top of the tweets feed. Users have their own Twitter pages, on which all of their tweets are listed in order of when they were sent, and it would be burdensome for a user who wants to view the tweets of multiple users to have to go to each of their pages. Thus, it is important that a user also has the Home Page to see multiple user&rsquo;s tweets (with information on a multitude of topics) at once. Further, the Home page has a search tool to be able to find other users as well as find specific content (e.g. searching for tweets about Barack Obama after the State of the Union speech)</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main visual challenge of Twitter&rsquo;s home page is the constantly updating tweets feed. Within seconds, &ldquo;__ new Tweets&rdquo; will appear at the top of the tweets feed; after the user selects it, all of the tweets he/she was previously viewing will shift down the page and new tweets will appear on top. Though there may be images in these tweets, the majority of information presented in the old tweets and new tweets is in words. The Home page may lose impact if users are not reading any of the old or new tweets because there seems to be too much of it all.</p>

<h2>Digg Reader</h2>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0A3j4-I9FC0/U11RZNWaxXI/AAAAAAAAT2c/sPrgMjf7C18/w830-h687-no/Digg+Reader+Wireframe+-+New+Page.jpeg" alt="Digg Reader Wireframe">
<p>When I go to <a href="http://digg.com/reader">http://digg.com/reader</a> and log in to my account, the page that appears shows all articles from my subscribed feeds.</p>
<p>Digg Reader is &ldquo;a news aggregator operatd by Digg&rdquo; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_Reader">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_Reader</a>). Users are able to subscribe to multiple sites through the Digg Reader site; they can then view news headlines/articles from these sites on a single page. Using Digg Reader makes it easy to keep track of news from multiple sources without having to go to every single news site. It is a one-stop shop.</p>
<p>If a user has subscribed to many news sites that update consisntetly through Digg Reader, the user&rsquo;s feed constantly updates. On the &ldquo;All&rdquo; articles page, headlines from all of these news sites appear in order of their posting with the newest first. If the user has subscribed to news sites which focus on different topics, all of these articles will still appear together in &ldquo;All&rdquo;. This can be a visual challenge, as it pushes too much information and too many topics onto a single screen with no images or many tools (beyond the Keyboard Shortcuts) to help the user digest the information.</p>

				User Experience and Design Analysis</a>

		<p>For Week 1, I selected the following favorite websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Below is analysis of these websites in terms of user experience and design.</p>

<h4>Google Drive</h4>

<p>I visit Google Drive multiple times in a single day to view, edit, and share personal andwork files. I love that I am able to access necessary files from anywhere.</p>

<p>The website has a simple design; it looks similar to a file folder one may find on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Further, files are easily searchable from the search tool. One can search the file name or even text from within a file. A user can also easily organize their files into related folders for easy searching and sharing. For important files, a user can use the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; tool.</p>

<p>Notably, despite this design similarity, there is still a learning curve. First, files do not appear automatically on Google Drive; there are setup and uploading steps. Google Drive also has its own format for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and other types of files. For example, while a user may upload a word processing document created in Microsoft Word, they will not be able to edit it in Google Drive, despite being able to see it. A new user will need to learn these rules to simply view and edit files. An added step for a new user is sharing, which has additional processes that may not be immediately familiar to a new user.</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>I utilize Twitter for quick, recent, and relevant news and information.</p>

<p>The website has user-created content. Users share 140-character text messages called &ldquo;tweets&rdquo; with their followers and on their page, which can be made public or available only to specific users. Users can also view all tweets of followed users on their home page. On this page, tweets appear in order, with the most recent tweet on top; one&rsquo;s home page updates frequently due to constant new tweets from followers. Also, the search tool makes it easy for anyone, whether a registered Twitter user or not, to search users, tweet content, or trending information or hashtags</p>

<p>Twitter can be overstimulating due to the constantly changing tweets feed. In this way, even though the website may only have 5 or so boxes, new tweet after new tweet can make it seem cluttered. The site is used by individuals, companies, and organizations who all may distribute different types of information to followers&ndash;it seems the value of the site can vary depending on this, for both viewers of tweets and tweeters.</p>

<p>I am most excited to use Twitter during specific moments, like the President&rsquo;s State of the Union, elections, awards shows, and important international events (e.g. events in Egypt or Syria). At these moments, Twitter provides minute-by-minute coverage from a seeminly unending supply of sources that is unmatched by any news station.</p>

<h4>Digg Reader</h4>

<p>Digg Reader is another useful site for news and information.</p>

<p>The website aggregates posts from news and related websites; the user subscribes to have these sites appear in his/her Digg Reader. These posts can appear all together under &ldquo;All.&rdquo; Or, the user is able to group these sites into folders for easier reading. Either way, with Digg Reader, the user does not have to visit each of the sites in which they are interested; Digg Reader becomes a one-stop shop for news and information from specific sources.</p>

<p>To browse through content, the user can simply click headlines or they can use keyboard shortcuts. When new content is posted on the websites to which the user is subscribed, &ldquo;__ new items&rdquo; appears in the sidebar. The user can choose to update their feed to include these new items. Unfortunately, there is no visible search option for the user to search their feed for specific articles.</p>

<p>If the user is subscribed to many websites, he/she may never finish reading the content on their Digg Reader. This may make the user feel differently each time he/she uses Digg Reader&ndash;at times, it may feel like he/she wasted a lot of time on information he/she didn&rsquo;t need at that time; other times, he/she may feel they have gained a lot of interesting information after stumbling on several articles from sites they love to follow.</p>

		<p>When I think of times in my life I&rsquo;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, I recall all of the following values:</p>

<p>Activism AdventureAutonomy ChallengeCommunity CompetenceCooperation EfficiencyExcitement FairnessFreedom FriendshipsGrowth Helping other peopleHelping society HonestyIndependence Inner harmonyInsight IntrospectionJustice LeadershipMeaningful work MentorshipPersistance Personal developmentPublic service QualityResponsibility Self-knowledgeSelf-reliance SpiritualityTruth VibrancyWisdom</p>

<p>FAIRNESS</p>

<p>The importance of this value to me stems, in part, from my years as a teacher in the Bronx. All of my students&#8217; families were low-income, most below the poverty line. What motivated me everyday in working with my students was the desire to ensure they had/have access to the same opportunities I, a person who was just lucky to be born into privilege, was afforded growing up &ndash; I seeked fairness.</p>

<p>In general, I try to live up these values: 5</p>

<p>The last topic on which someone asked me advice was career. A friend teaches at a charter school but is interested in other opportunities in education.</p>
